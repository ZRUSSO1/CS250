# CS250

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?<br />
# Since I haven’t worked with real users yet, I try to imagine what someone using the program might expect or need. In class, we use user stories or project descriptions to figure that out. I’ve learned that understanding the user’s goal is the first step. From there, I break it down into features the program should include. I’m still learning how to take those needs and turn them into working code, but so far, writing things out in plain language has helped. User stories make it easier to understand what the software is supposed to do. Writing out something like “As a user, I want to...” helps me stay focused on the actual purpose behind each feature. It keeps things simple and clear. Even though I haven’t done this in a real-world project, using user stories in assignments has helped me think from the user’s perspective instead of just jumping into code.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?<br />
# Right now, I usually start by figuring out the main goal, then I work step by step on each part. I also try to test my code as I go. In the future, I hope to use Agile practices like working in short sprints, getting feedback early, and collaborating with a team. I’ve read about daily standups and sprint reviews, and I think they would be helpful to keep things on track and adjust when something’s not working.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?<br />
# From what I’ve learned in class, being a good team member means being reliable, listening to others, and communicating clearly. Even though I haven’t worked on a real team yet, I think being open to feedback and willing to help others is really important. Everyone should feel like they’re working together toward the same goal. I hope to bring that mindset into any future development work I do.
